# Portfolio Styling and Backend Removal TODO

## Tasks
- [x] Delete server.js to remove backend dependency
- [x] Update Contact.jsx to handle form submission without backend (simulate success or use EmailJS)
- [x] Adjust light mode colors in index.css to fix color collisions and make it professional
- [x] Test the frontend-only portfolio website

## Notes
- Keep dark mode colors and functionality intact
- Ensure professional light mode styling with no color clashes
- Portfolio should run entirely in frontend
